## Introduction

The Internet has become an indispensable part of our life, However, It also has provided opportunities to anonymously perform malicious activities like Phishing. Phishers try to deceive their victims by social engineering or creating mockup websites to steal information such as account ID, username, password from individuals and organizations. Although many methods have been proposed to detect phishing websites, Phishers have evolved their methods to escape from these detection methods. One of the most successful methods for detecting these malicious activities is Machine Learning. This is because most Phishing attacks have some common characteristics which can be identified by machine learning methods. To see project click [here]("/").


## Installation
The Code is written in Python 3.6.10. If you don't have Python installed you can find it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip. To install the required packages and libraries, run this command in the project directory after [cloning](https://www.howtogeek.com/451360/how-to-clone-a-github-repository/) the repository:
```bash
1. Environment setup.
```
conda create --prefix venv python==3.6.10 -y
```
conda activate venv/
````
2. Install Requirements and setup
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Run Application
```
python app.py
```
